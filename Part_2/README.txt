Project:        Integrating epidemiological and genetic data with different sampling densities into a dynamic model of RSV transmission.

This work describes the analysis of household cohort data collected over a period of 6 months covering an epidemic of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The data was collected from a rural coastal community in Kenya in 2009.The aim of the analysis is to gain a better understanding of RSV transmission for the purpose of intervention planning. This work is an extension of the project titled "Model-based estimates of transmission of respiratory syncytial virus within households" whose files are given in folder labelled 'Part_1'. The model in Part 1 was fit to social-temporal data of shedding patterns collected from 47 households over a 6-month period. In this part, the model is extended to include the use of genetic data. The coding was done on two platforms, R and julia. R was used to modify the data and visualise results, while julia was used for its computational efficiency to run the model fitting. The data was fit in three ways: with identification at the pathogen level, and the RSV group level and at the genetic cluster level. For each level there are 2 julia files, a file containing the functions and another running the model. As such, there are 6 julia files in total and 2 R files.
